# 🎦Animation-Player-Module 

This small project aims to create an easy-use animation handler for Roblox Studio projects. I made this project for personal usage to reduce lines in my systems and get an easy way to replace default animations, as well as organizing my animations under an easy folder structure.

## ✈Technologies

  * `Lua/Luau`
  * `Roblox Studio STLs`

## 🌠Features 

  *  Easy and customizable folder system with automatic detection
  *  Replacing default Roblox animations
  *  Animation freezing and stopping

## Why❓

I first struggled with animations, animation players, keyframe event handling and the export procedure to make them actual useful. This module tries to solve that in a way that takes the least amount of difficulty for the user. I also wanted to take a deeper look on animation in the low level side for learning propuses.

## 🚅Using the module
This module is old so it needs a checkout. I will publish a public interface whenever I think the module can actually be useful for people other than me. If you know what you are doing you are free to use and modify it.
